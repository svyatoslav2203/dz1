			<P>The National Hockey League (NHL; French: Ligue nationale de hockey—LNH) is a professional ice hockey league in North America, currently comprising 31 teams: 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada. The NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world,[3] and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America,[4] is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.

The National Hockey League was organized on November 26, 1917, at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the National Hockey Association (NHA), which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew, Ontario.[5] The NHL immediately took the NHA's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926.</P>

		<p>NHL.com is providing in-depth roster, prospect and fantasy analysis for each of its 31 teams throughout August. Today, the Anaheim Ducks. The Anaheim Ducks added some depth at forward and defenseman to a lineup that doesn't look much different from the one that reached the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the sixth straight season in 2017-18. They signed 30-year-old Brian Gibbons and 29-year-old Carter Rowney as free agents July 2 to join a forward group that features <a href="https://www.nhl.com/player/ryan-getzlaf-8470612"> Ryan Getzlaf</a>, Adam Henrique, Ryan Kesler, Corey Perry, Rickard Rakell and Jakob Silfverberg. Anaheim also signed free agent defensemen Luke Schenn, 28, and Andrej Sustr, 27, for this season to help a group led by Cam Fowler, Hampus Lindholm, Josh Manson and Brandon Montour.s</p>

		<h3>Stars, Lightning driven to win toughest Stanley Cup title ahead of Game 6</h3>

		<p><mark>The Dallas Stars and Tampa Bay Lightning each entered the bubble July 26. That was 64 days ago.</mark>

,The Stars traveled to Edmonton, where they've been ever since. The Lightning started out in Toronto, then moved on to Edmonton for the Eastern Conference Final and now the Stanley Cup Final.

"It's tough," Tampa Bay center Barclay Goodrow said Sunday, sporting a thick beard and a cut on the bridge of his nose. "It's been, whatever, how many number of days. But when you think back to when we first got to Toronto, that seems like six months ago.

"Like, it's been a grind. Yeah, there's definitely a lot of things that you miss. But ultimately, if we end up winning the trophy, it makes all those sacrifices worth it."

The end is coming, one way or another. 

Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final is at Rogers Place in Edmonton on Monday (8 p.m. ET; NBC, CBC, SN, TVAS). If the Lightning win, they raise the Cup. If the Stars win, they force Game 7 on Wednesday.

In normal times, we like to say the Stanley Cup is the hardest trophy to win in sports because of the tremendous physical, mental and emotional investment made in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

These aren't normal times, of course.</p>
